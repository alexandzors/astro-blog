## Overview

Wanted to drop a quick update while I'm currently busy with some work/life stuff. Hence, the lack of posts since December. Anyhow, my [third party image](https://hub.docker.com/r/alexandzors/caddy) for [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) now supports arm64! You can pull the image using the tag(s):

- `v#.#.#-arm64`
- `latest-arm64`

*An arm64 binary is also available on the [releases page](https://github.com/alexandzors/caddy/releases). Support for Windows Containers is currently not planned. Though I am welcome to a PR to update the workflow to support it.*

As you can see above, my image now tags the version of Caddy when pushing the images to Docker hub starting with v2.7.6. This is so you can pull a tagged version instead of just using `latest` if you need a specific version. My image will always build with stable versions of Caddy. It skips all pre-release versions. If you run into issues with the image, please reach out via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/alexandzors/caddy/issues) or email!

## Module updates

The module `RussellLuo/caddy-ext/ratelimit` was replaced with `mholt/caddy-ratelimit`.

## Third Party Note

This is a third party build for [Caddy](https:///caddyserver.com/). Please do not use this in a production environment. This is merely available for me and anyone else that needs a quick docker image / binary with the below plugins already installed. You can always use the [download page](https://caddyserver.com/download) to generate your own binary or use the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy).
