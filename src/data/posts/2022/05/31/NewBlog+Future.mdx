Life has changed a lot since I started my blog. My wife and I had two kids and then the covid pandemic hit. Last November my wife and I moved out of our apartment just has the housing market in the US decided to explode which priced us out of buying a home. This inadvertently affected my homelab, my blog, and my business [Alex's Guardian](https://alexsguardian.net). That and COVID really slowed down the adoption of new clients for my wife and I. Not having the time to work on things really puts a damper on getting things done haha.

Both of my sites are hosted on [LinodeðŸ’œ](https://www.linode.com/?r=67f6812cc5712674183021660b122e45095f35b5) using Wordpress in Docker. This was a nightmare to manage as both required a MySQL DB, plugins, and a proper theme. Both sites used mostly the same plugin stack and the Divi theme from [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/). However, if you are not aware Wordpress is built on PHP and as you add plugins and a full site editing theme it gets very, very resource hungry. This made it rather annoying to create posts and update pages as it crashed a lot and sometimes locked up my Linode VM. I am only using the nano tier from Linode to keep costs down so having three Wordpress sites (my blog, my biz, and my wife's WIP biz site) quickly killed my VM. I ended up splitting the blog off onto its own nano tier VM to compensate.

## Why the theme change... again?

After watching a the video from [Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q) (who you should seriously sub to) on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I have decided to move all of my websites to it moving forward (blog first). The main reasons for me were:

1. No DB requirement = less overhead
2. Posts are managed via Markdown files (yes please!) 
    - which means not having to load an interface to create them.
    - websites can be fully managed via git + CI/CD
3. Easy customizations

Moving to Jekyll and easy post creation has reignited my drive to blog again. Now this does mean that a lot of my previous posts from Wordpress will be lost and I will not be moving them over. This includes the older guides. I will however, be recreating the most popular ones with updated info though in the coming weeks/months as I finish upgrading my backend Linode hosts and getting my pipeline updated for Jekyll deployments. I will be creating a post, *soon<sup>tm</sup>*, talking about the process of auto deploying this blog to one of my Linode hosts!

## What about your homelab?

My wife and I moved out of our apartment in November of 2021 with the intent to purchase a home so our kids no longer had to share a small bedroom. We did not anticipate the housing market to explode like it did so we were unable to re-sign our lease in time. This forced us to temporarily move back in with my parents while we search for a home. Because of this I had to downsize my homelab dramatically. I no longer have my 4u main VM server which used to run most of my homelab. I did however purchase two Optiplex 5050 micros to use instead as they take up A LOT less space. With losing my main VM server I did lose my old monitoring setup with Grafana, etc. So now that things have settled I will be setting that back up with my new "mini cluster."
