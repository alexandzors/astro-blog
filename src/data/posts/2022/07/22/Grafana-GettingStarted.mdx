So you've seen a cool Dashboard on [/r/homelab](https://reddit.com/r/homelab) with graphs and status panels, and now you want one for your lab. Well let me tell you a little secret. It's actually really easy to set up! This guide series will walk you through how to set up [Grafana](https://grafana.com), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/get-influxdb/), [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/), and a few other data services that pair nicely in a homelab setting. This will be a "get your feet wet" guide series and will get you in the door of the fun world of metrics and monitoring. We will be starting from complete scratch, so to follow along make sure you read through the prerequisites below.

# The Environment

This guide series assumes you are on Windows 10 or 11 with [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), the [OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui) installed and to keep this guide easy to update in the future, that you already have a Ubuntu Server or similar Linux imaged system already running and ready. If you do not know how to install Ubuntu Server, check out [this guide from Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview).

## Pre-Requisites

- Have an x86 computing device (PC, Server, Workstation, Micro PC, etc.) with Ubuntu Server installed.
  - You can use a Raspberry Pi or other ARM based device. Just make sure to change docker / compose commands to use built for ARM images instead.
- Have an IDE / Text Editor installed on your pc.
  - I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) installed.
- Access to a good internet connection.
- Have a spare monitor and keyboard handy.
- Your favorite drink and snacks within reach. ( A must for hobbies )

# Grafana

If you are not familiar with Grafana, let me give you a quick run down on what it is and is not. Grafana is a data visualization tool that allows you to observe your data using charts, graphs, etc. It is not a replacement for things like [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) / [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy) or other similar dashboard software. Basically if you are wanting to monitor service metrics / logs then Grafana is for you.

<Aside type="caution">
This guide series was originally created with Grafana version 9!
</Aside>

## Connecting to the Machine

First thing we need to do is hook up Visual Studio Code (VSC) to the machine we will be running Grafana, etc. on. For this we will be using the Remote - SSH extension for VSC. ( If you don't have the extension installed yet, go ahead and install it. )

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh`
2. Right click and select "New > Text Document"
3. Name the new file `vsc_config` and remove the `.txt` extension.

<Aside type="note">
I like to keep SSH hosts for VSC separate from my main config file. You do not have to do this if you want to use the default `config` file for SSH.
</Aside>

4. Open Visual Studio Code and click on Extensions in the navigation column on the left. 
5. Under "Installed Extensions" find "Remote - SSH" and click on the settings gear then extension setting.
6. In the field labeled "Remote.SSH: Config File" add the location of your SSH config file.
  - If you created the file above it will be `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\vsc_config`
  - If you are using your default ssh config file then the path will be `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\config`
7. Close the settings Window
8. Click on the green icon in the lower left 
9. In the dropdown at the top click on "Connect Current Window to Host..."
10. Click on "+ Add New SSH Host..."
11. Enter your connection string for the Grafana host machine.
  - e.g. `username@192.168.10.1`
12. Hit Enter
13. Select your SSH config file from the drop-down
14. Click Connect in the popup notification in the lower right
15. In the new VSC window select "Linux" from the dropdown
16. If you did not include an identity file in your connection string, enter your password in the prompt.
17. Hit Enter to connect to the machine

<Aside type="note">
VSC will set up code server on your machine on first log in. The progress will be displayed in a notification in the lower right. When this is complete you can start using VSC to navigate and edit files on your System. As long as you have the correct permissions.
</Aside>

## Installing Docker

<Aside type="note">
To make this guide easy we will be using Docker to run our services with Grafana. This will make it easy to add / remove services without bloating the host OS with dependencies.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
Docker has an excellent [documentation site](https://docs.docker.com) that includes [Docker Engine installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) steps that are kept up to date. So check there if you run into any issues with the steps below.
</Aside>

To install Docker we first need to add the apt repository for it to Ubuntu's apt repository index. Run the following commands to install the prerequisites. You can run these commands in the terminal inside VSC since we are connected to our machine over SSH. If the terminal is not showing you can open by clicking on "Terminal" and then "New Terminal" in the toolbar.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
# Update the apt index
sudo apt update

# Install pre-requisites for apt to use HTTPS repositories (These are most likely already installed)
sudo apt install \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg \
  lsb-release
```

Now we need to add Docker's official GPG key:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Next add the official repository for Docker:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Once the repository is added, we can install the Docker Engine and Docker Compose:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

After Docker installs we can add our user to the Docker group, so we don't have to use `sudo` before every Docker command.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
sudo usermod -aG docker yourusername
```

<Aside type="note">
It is usually recommended that you log out of your session and log back in to make sure your user was properly updated. To do this via the Remote - SSH plugin, click on the green button in the lower left and then click "Close Remote Connection." You can then use the same flow from the steps above to log back into the machine via VSC.
</Aside>

<Image src={DOCKER_SETUP} alt="Docker Setup" width={1920} />

We can check if Docker Engine and Docker Compose were installed properly by running their version commands.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
docker version
docker compose version
```

You should see an output similar to the image below.

<Image src={DOCKER_VERSION} alt="Docker Engine / Compose Version" width={800} height={600} />
<ImgDesc>Output examples of `docker version` and `docker compose version`</ImgDesc>

While we are working on Docker, let's update the logging driver to keep our log files from getting huge. Doing this now means we do not have to define it ourselves in the compose files later. To do this we need to edit the `daemon.json` file located in `/etc/docker/`. You will need to run this command from a terminal session (can be inside VSC's terminal).

```shell showLineNumbers=false
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

Then copy the following JSON configuration into the file.

```json title="daemon.json"
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-level": "",
  "log-opts": {
    "cache-disabled": "false",
    "cache-max-file": "5",
    "cache-max-size": "20m",
    "cache-compress": "true",
    "max-file": "2",
    "max-size": "10m"
  }
}
```

Save and close the file by hitting `CTRL + X` then `y`.

<Aside type="tip">
If you get a "Do you trust the authors of these files?" prompt, like the example below. Just click on "Open" to continue.

# Setting up Prometheus

Now that we have Docker installed and configured we can start setting up our services. First up is Prometheus! We will be using Prometheus to gather metrics from our host machine via Node Exporter. First let's create a directory structure for Prometheus.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
sudo mkdir -p /opt/docker/prometheus
cd /opt/docker/prometheus
```

Next create the `docker-compose.yml` file and edit it.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
touch docker-compose.yml
code docker-compose.yml
```

Copy the following into the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
services:
  prometheus:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
      - prometheus_data:/prometheus
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
      - '--web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries'
      - '--web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles'
    ports:
      - 9090:9090

volumes:
  prometheus_data: {}
```

Save the file using `CTRL+S`. You can close it by clicking the `X` next to the name in the tab bar.

## Deploying Node Exporter

Since we are deploying Node Exporter as another Docker container, we need to create the compose file for it. So let's make a new directory in `/opt/docker/prometheus` to house it.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
mkdir exporters
cd exporters
```

Next create the `docker-compose.yml` file and edit it.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
touch node-exporter.yml
code node-exporter.yml
```

Copy the following into the `node-exporter.yml` file:

```yaml title="node-exporter.yml"
version: '3'
services:
  node_exporter:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest
    command:
      - '--path.rootfs=/host'
    network_mode: host
    pid: host
    volumes:
      - '/:/host:ro,rslave'
```

Save the file using `CTRL+S`. You can close it by clicking the `X` next to the name in the tab bar. Now deploy Node Exporter:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
docker compose -f node-exporter.yml up -d
```

<Aside type="tip">
Notice the `-f node-exporter.yml` parameter. This allows you to specify compose files that are in a different directory or non-standard named ones.
</Aside>

To verify that it's working you can run:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
curl localhost:9100/metrics
```

You should see an output like the following:

<Image src={PROMETHEUS_UI} alt="Prometheus Graph UI" width={800} height={600} />

## Configuring Prometheus to Scrape Node Exporter

Now that we have Node Exporter running we can update Prometheus to scrape it for data. Edit the `prometheus.yml` file with the following:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
cd ..
code prometheus.yml
```

Copy the following into the Prometheus config file:

```yaml title="prometheus.yml"
# Set global scrape interval (how long between prometheus data scrapes on exporters)
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

# Define the scrape job(s)
scrape_configs:
- job_name: node
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['<your-machine-ip>:9100']
```

Replace `<your-machine-ip>` with the IP of your Docker host. Then save the file using `CTRL+S`. You can close it by clicking the `X` next to the name in the tab bar.

## Deploying Prometheus

To deploy Prometheus, run the following command inside the `/opt/docker/prometheus` directory.

```shell showLineNumbers=false
docker compose up -d
```

Once deployed, open a browser tab and navigate to `http://your-docker-machine-ip:9090/graph`. When Prometheus's query UI loads run the following in the Expression box.

```
rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"}[1m])
```

You should see an output similar to the one pictured below.

<Image src={PROMETHEUS_UI} alt="Prometheus Graph UI" width={800} height={600} />

# Configuring Grafana to Use Prometheus

With Prometheus running and scraping metrics from our Node Exporter, we can now configure Grafana to read that data and display it in a dashboard. So first login to Grafana, then follow the steps below to set up the Prometheus data source and configure the dashboard.

1. Click on the Settings cog
2. Click "Data sources"
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_1} alt="Add Prometheus 1" width={800} height={600} />
3. Click the "Add data source" button
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_2} alt="Add Prometheus 2" width={800} height={600} />
4. Click on "Prometheus" from the list of options
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_3} alt="Add Prometheus 3" width={800} height={600} />
5. Fill out the following info:
    a. Name your data source (default is Prometheus)
    b. Enter `http://your-machine-ip:9090` for the URL
    c. Click Save & test
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_4} alt="Add Prometheus 4" width={800} height={600} />
6. After you click "Save & test" you should see a green check mark notification tell you the data source is working.
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_5} alt="Add Prometheus 5" width={800} height={600} />
7. Click the Dashboard button in the left-hand menu
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_6} alt="Add Prometheus 6" width={800} height={600} />
8. Click on "Import"
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_7} alt="Add Prometheus 7" width={800} height={600} />
9. Importing the Dashboard
    a. Enter `1860` into the "Import via grafana.com" box
    b. Click Load
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_8} alt="Add Prometheus 8" width={800} height={600} />
    c. Edit the name of your Dashboard (what will be displayed)
    d. Select "Prometheus (default)" from the dropdown
    e. Click Import
    <Image src={ADD_PROM_9} alt="Add Prometheus 9" width={800} height={600} />

After you click Import, you will be taken to your new dashboard! You can now explore the dashboard, as well as the queries each panel is making to Prometheus.
